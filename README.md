# Efficient Clipping of Arbitrary Polygons using OpenGPL

Based on the paper "Efficient Clipping of Arbitrary Polygons" by GÃ¼nther Greiner (greiner[at]informatik.uni-erlangen.de) and Kai Hormann (hormann[at]informatik.tu-clausthal.de), ACM Transactions on Graphics 1998;17(2):71-83.

## Motivation

This work was created for educational purposes only, as an implementation in Python of the above algorithm, for a class in Graphical Computation.

To study the algorithm, inspect the file `polygon.py`. It can be imported and used in other contexts (i.e., not OpenGL).

### Import

```python
> import polygon
> help(polygon)
> from polygon import *
```


## Command line

The command line interface (`polyclip.py`) is provided for demonstration or testing purposes, using OpenGL.

### Requirements

Supports Python 2.5 or later.

Requires **PyOpenGL** (version 3 as of this writing). If you have pip, install is easy:

`pip install pyopengl`


## Usage

Supported operations are: union, intersection and difference.

### Polygon overrides

Subject and clip polygon can be defined per command line option. Defaults for the subject and clip polygon are set at the beggining of the file for easy edit, but they can be overriden from the command line using the options `--subj-poly` and `--clip-poly`.

**Example:**

`polyclip.py --subj-poly="1.5, 1.25; 7.5, 2.5; 4, 3; 4.5, 6.5"`

### Options

Type `polyclip.py -h` for available options. Press `Esc` to exit.
