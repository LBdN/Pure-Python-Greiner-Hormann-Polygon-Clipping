# Efficient Clipping of Arbitrary Polygons using OpenGPL

Based on the paper "Efficient Clipping of Arbitrary Polygons" by GÃ¼nther Greiner (greiner[at]informatik.uni-erlangen.de) and Kai Hormann (hormann[at]informatik.tu-clausthal.de), ACM Transactions on Graphics 1998;17(2):71-83.

## Motivation

This work was created for educational purposes only, as an implementation in Python of the above algorithm, for a class in Graphical Computation.


## Requirements

Tested on Python 2.7, not sure what minimal version is supported.

Requires **PyOpenGL**. If you have pip, install is easy:

`pip install pyopengl`


## Usage

Supported operations are: union, intersection and difference.

Subject and clip polygon can be defined per command line option. Defaults for the subject and clip polygon are set at the beggining of the file for easy edit, but they can be overriden from the command line using the options `--subject-poly` and `--clip-poly`.

**Example:**

`polyclip.py --subject-poly="1.5,1.25;7.5,2.5;4,3;4.5,6.5"`

Type `polyclip.py -h` for available options. Press `Esc` to exit.
